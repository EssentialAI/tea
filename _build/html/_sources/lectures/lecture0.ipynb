    "Finally, there is one type of positive definite matrix that comes up frequently, and so deserves some special mention. Given any matrix $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times n}$ (not necessarily symmetric or even square), the matrix $G = A^TA$ (sometimes called a **Gram Matrix**) is always positive semidefinite.
