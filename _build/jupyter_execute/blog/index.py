# ## [Can 4 output neurons classify 10 classes?](mnist-4-neurons/index.ipynb)
# 
# The answer is Yes! Wait a minute! Shouldn't there be as many output neurons as the number of classes for an image classification model? Actually No! We shall dive deep into this topic using mathematical reasoning. This article is a solution to an exercise in the "Neural networks and Deep Learning" book by Micheal Nielsen.
