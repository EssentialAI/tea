# The Essential AI

**The Essential AI** is an initiative by an engineering graduate from a non-CS background currently pursuing research in Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically, Vision-Language multimodal AI models. **The Essential AI** aims to enable students from any educational background to pursue a career in AI. We believe there is a disconnect between learning and understanding AI, and that math is the only way to bridge this gap. And this we try to achieve by instilling a sense of mathematical intuition that is necessary to understand AI.

## Why Math is important for Machine Learning (and AI in general)?

There are a plethora of online courses on Machine Learning and AI, yet, truly comprehending the traits of AI has been a very difficult task. This is because several online courses teach Machine Learning as if it's just a plug-and-play game. One cannot thrive in the field of Machine Learning without appreciating the Math involved. It is widely believed that mathematical intuition is essential for comprehending the current State of the Art models.
